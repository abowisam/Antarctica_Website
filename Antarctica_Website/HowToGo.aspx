            <b>Which route to take:</b> While 98% of visitors approach Antarctica via the tip of South America, as this is the quickest and most accessible route, there are other ways to reach the white continent. Discover the main routes to Antarctica.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cruise or fly?</b> Traditionally, sailing was the only way to reach Antarctica, and it still remains the most common route, but it's now also possible via a short 2-hour flight, for those for whom time is a luxury. Read our guide on sailing vs flying.

    <h2>How do I get to Antarctica?</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Sailing from Ushuaia, Argentina - The most popular gateway to Antarctica for 90% of visitors with the widest choice of voyages. This is one of the most common Antarctica cruise routes.
        </li>
        <li>Flying by charter plane from Punta Arenas, Chile - Reach the Antarctic Peninsula in just 2 hours, instead of 2 days at sea. Perfect for time sensitive or anxious travellers.
        </li>
        <li>Sailing from South Island, New Zealand - Only four voyages each season depart from here to Antarctica's remote Ross Sea, home to emperor penguins.
        </li>
        <li>Flying into Antarctica's interior from Punta Arenas, Chile - Land on a blue ice runway in the heart of the white continent. Limited departures each season.
        </li>
        <li>& 6. Flying to the South Pole - For a lucky handful each season, you can fly to the South Pole from either Punta Arenas, Chile or Cape Town, South Africa, and spend some time in Union Glacier Camp.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can get to Antarctica by boat or plane. Sailing the Drake Passage from the tip of South America to the Antarctic Peninsula takes 48 hours. Flying to Antarctica takes 2 hours. Approximately 54,000 visitors make the journey each year, with around 50 expedition vessels sailing Antarctic waters each season.
    </p>
    <h2>Can I cruise or fly to Antarctica?</h2>
    <h3>Cruising to Antarctica</h3>
    <p>Sailing remains the most popular way to get to Antarctica, and for good reason. For purists following in Scott and Shackleton's footsteps, or for those looking to enjoy every minute of the adventure, sailing to Antarctica is all part of the experience. Cruise ships depart from Ushuaia, commonly regarded as the southernmost city in the world, before leaving South America behind to reach Antarctica.</p>
    <p>
        Pragmatically, an Antarctic cruise offers the widest choice of voyage types, ships, departure dates and prices, and has the advantage of departures in November and March when flights to Antarctica don't operate. The following Antarctic cruises are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Antarctic Peninsula & South Shetland Islands</li>
        <li>South Georgia, The Falkland Islands & Antarctica</li>
        <li>Polar Circle</li>
        <li>Weddell Sea</li>
        <li>Ross Sea</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Cruising to Antarctica involves crossing The Drake Passage, a fairly notorious stretch of water. Approximately 30% of voyages experience rough weather, however it can also be surprisingly placid too, at which time it's euphemistically called 'The Drake Lake'. The reality for the majority of our customers is that it's rarely as bad as it sounds, and it's certainly a 'price' well worth paying.
    </p>
    <h3>Flying to Antarctica</h3>
    <p>
        
        There is an option to fly to Antarctica from Southern Chile before embarking your ship, which is becoming increasingly popular. The benefits in terms of time saved and the assurance of avoiding crossing the Drake Passage are undoubtedly compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        This fly cruise option means you can spend your time experiencing rather than travelling. A flight to King George Island sets you down right in the heart of the action. In just 2 hours you can step off your plane on the Antarctic Peninsula, feeling the nip of the air and ready to spot your first iceberg.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you book in your Fly & Cruise voyage it's worth noting that your choice of ships, itinerary and departures dates is more limited than when cruising to Antarctica. You should also expect to pay approximately 20% more than if you were to sail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the majority of flights each season run on schedule, flying also carries a higher risk of delays due to the rapidly changing conditions that make accurate forecasting a challenge. However, delays are often no longer than a few hours, and for many, the modest risk in opting to fly is more than outweighed by the significant gains.
